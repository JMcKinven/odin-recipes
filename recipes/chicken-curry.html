    <p>Dale Pinnock's red lentil and chicken curry recipe helps to lower cholesterol and it's rich in soluble fibre.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 large red onions</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>400g red lentils</li>
        <li>1.5L vegetable stock</li>
        <li>6 skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp madras curry paste</li>
        <li>300g baby leaf spinach</li>
        <li>Natural yoghurt to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a little olive oil in a very large pan, add the onions and garlic, then fry for 4-5 minutes until 
        softened. Add the lentils and a little of the stock and simmer. Keep adding small amounts of stock, bit by bit, 
        as the lentils cook and soften, as if you were cooking a risotto. </li>
        <li>Once the lentils start to break down, add the chicken and curry paste and stir well. Keep simmering and 
            adding stock for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is cooked and you've added all the stock.</li>
        <li>Add the baby spinach at the Last minute, a handful at a time, season with salt and pepper and stir 
            until the spinach has wilted. Serve immediately, with a dollop of yogurt on the side if you like.</li>
    </ol>
